# Axure-Sync-Server

The `local` boolean variable in `script.js` has to be set accordingly before pasting the code into an axure-object that loads the javascript on pageload.

The server can be hosted locally or in the cloud to make requests to it. If dont use the host provided by Jarne under `https://express-axure-test.onrender.com/` then you have to change the `urlHostedServer` variable as well.

## Deployment

- Build Command: `yarn` or `npm install`
- Start Command: `node app.jsn`
